
Ideas:
* Deposit accounts for the money collected when building/creating/linking/using gates.
* Implement gate permissions when Permissions plugin supports adding a gate to a group.
* Per-world inventories?
* Add API options like allow*

TODO:
* Add world gates that only accept arrivals and no outbound links. Lets server place player in the world?
* Add commands to extract part of a world into a design file.
* Add feedback output when server connect command is given (http://dev.bukkit.org/server-mods/transporter/?comment=1012).



Testing:
* Test stairs with facing option

Wiki Updates:

Changelog:
* Fixed buggy gate building/creating.
* Fixed bug with the "gate destroy" command.
* Fixed bug with closing gates via redstone.
* Fixed bug with spawn direction for area gates.
* Fixed bug where gate files weren't closed after loading, so destroying a gate didn't delete the file.
* Updated materials.txt.
* Made design detection during gate creation a bit faster.
* Added global options "checkVersion" and "updateMetrics" for turning off plugin version checking and metrics reporting to http://mcstats.org/ at plugin load time.
* Added new design option "attribution" to allow crediting a design during load.
* Added additional error checking to designs during load.
* Added new "Plaza" design. Thanks go to Melekaiah for the hard work. I just tweaked some things.

The new Plaza design is quite large (41x41x15). It might choke your server for second or two when building or creating it. I recommend building it on a large flat area, or in the sky.
